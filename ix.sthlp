{phang}
{it:yvar} is the variable name for the binary outcome. 

{phang}
{it:var1} is the variable name for the first exposure,binary or continuous.If binary, it must be coded as 0/1.

{phang}
{it:var2} is the variable name for the second exposure,binary or continuous.If binary, it must be coded as 0/1.

{phang}
{it:cvars} are the variable names for the covariates to be included in the model for the outcome.

{phang}
{it:vt(#)} specifies the type of the two varialbes whose interaction that you are interested,bb,cb or cc.bb:two binary ones,cc:two continuous ones,cb:one binary and one continous varialbe.


{phang}
{it:Attention:} when evaluating interaction between one binary and one continous variables, var1 must be continous varialbe.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ix} On additive and multiplicative scale, evaluating interation with logistic model or boostrap between two varialbes ,which can be both binary, both continous or their conbination.

{pstd}
{cmd:ix} provides standard result presentation according recommendations authored by Knol Mirjam J. and VanderWeele Tyler J. published in 2012[1]. Exploring interaction between continuous variables with bootstrap,by converting continous varialbe to binary variable based on a range of numlist.



{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt ct(#)} specifies the calculation for assessing interaction.There are 4 choices:bs,v,g,d and r.{p_end}

{p 7 6 2}{opt bs}: calcute RERI,AP and S with bootstrap.{p_end}
{p 7 6 2}{opt v}: when specifing vt(#) as vt(cb),this option converts continuous variable into binary variable for each value defined by value() and calculate RERI.When specifing vt(#) as vt(cc),this option converts the two continous varialbes into binary ones based on numlist defined by valuex() and valuey() and calculate RERI,valuey for var1 and valuex() for var2.{p_end}
{p 7 6 2}{opt g}: when specifing vt(#) as vt(cb),n(integer) is required, and this option sorts continuous variable and then grouping it with function {cmd:group()}.{p_end}
{p 7 6 2}{opt d}: when specifing vt(#) as vt(cb),n(integer) is required, and this option groups continous varialbe with the function {cmd:autocode()}.{p_end}
{p 7 6 2}{opt r}: when specifing vt(#) as vt(rb),this option is for one rank varialbe and one binary variable.{p_end}
